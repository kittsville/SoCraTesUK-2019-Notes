# Building in the Dark

Discussion on prototyping a project over the a long period of time. Four of us
turned up so it was more of a close-knit conversation.

- People had very different experiences including:
  - Prototype games
  - Large greenfield software projects
  - Refactoring unreadable legacy software
- It's not necessarily a bad thing to spend a long time prototyping
  - Technology choices can turn out inappropriate or requirements can become clearer
  - Games being an art-form there aren't strict requirements and user feedback can majorly change functionality
- People managed to [inject Flappy Bird into Mario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6eY73sLV0)!?!
