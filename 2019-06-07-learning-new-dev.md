# How to improve learning for new devs

- Clear expectations/goals for the first few weeks/months
  - Longer term career progression goals
- Time every week for self learning and exploration of the codebase
  - This came up several times
- An inclusive environment so they feel part of the team
- Variety of tasks
  - Don't pigeonhole them to one part of the codebase
  - Rotate team roles or between teams
- Remove stigma around failure
  - Mistakes should be celebrated as a learning experience
  - Postmortem culture
- Regular and actionable feedback
- Personal retrospectives with a mentor
- Given time to let what they've learnt sink in
- Opportunity to deliver value in the first week
  - Push to ship their changes so they see their work having impact
- Tasks are challenging but with a support/safety net
