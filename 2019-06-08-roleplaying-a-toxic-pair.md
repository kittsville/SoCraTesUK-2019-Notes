# Roleplaying a Toxic Pair

  - Pair programming with one person pretending to be be a toxic co-worker and another trying to deal with their behaviour
  - Toxic behaviours included being over-controlling, elitist or disengaged
  - Mention of the [Driver/Navigator](https://gist.github.com/jordanpoulton/607a8854673d9f22c696) pairing model to avoid a senior pairing partner taking too much control
  - Those with power (knowledge/seniority) imbalances should ensure they give their partner sufficient agency to engage meaningfully in the task at hand
  - Issues when pairing could be symptomatic of larger issues with an organisation
    - Is the partner safe to call out this behaviour without fear of retribution?
    - Kill the rockstar devs
  - Prioritise upskilling/knowledge transfer to reduce future imbalances
