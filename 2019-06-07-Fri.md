## Organisation Smells

[Original SoCraTes wiki page](https://github.com/lscc/socrates-uk/wiki/Organisation-Smells)

Signs of good and bad culture/practices at an organisation, with some action
items for fixing them.

I've organised/trimmed the list to reflect those relevant to Intent HQ. Not
necessarily because we have them but because we could in future, for better or
worse.

### Good Smells

- Including engineers in roadmap planning
- Leadership is reachable and acts on feedback
- Generous training budget/10% time
- Team participate in the discovery of the product (Story mapping, event storming gherkin)
- Company wide retros (doesn't necessarily scale)
- Organisational goals are well communicated & understood
- People talking about how they feel
- Openly admitting ignorance / mistakes especially senior people being vulnerable
- Colleagues being friends/caring about each other
- Suggestions welcome from outside a team


### Bad Smells
- Accountability without responsibility/authority
- Product owner coming up with features without discussion
- Hidden Salaries
- Cherry picking devs to do tasks
- Management is absent
- New work everyday/frequently changing focus/no overall plan
- No time for experimentation
- Not quality driven just delivery driven
- Lack of collaboration between teams
  - (action) Align incentives of decision makers
- Team members in different locations who never meet in person
- People hoarding information
- No person or process to resolve conflicts/contradictions between information silos
- Prioritising team's work over organisational goals
- People preferring to beg forgiveness than ask permission
- Overprotectiveness of one's code & other resources
- Diktat not discussion/orders without explanation
- No open critique
- Deadline as method of enforcement
- Business architects write big features then don't engage with fleshing them out
- People trying to do too much
- Teams being ordered to work in ways that they know suck
- Carrying on with projects against the advice of engineers
- Management ignorant of the domain they are managing
- Artificial harmony (pretending everything is fine)
  - (action) Build a culture of respectful conflict
- Prioritising loud (large) customer over smaller but more numerous customers
- Not being able to be vulnerable
- Lack of trust
- Crappy behaviour (bullying etc) tolerated from "Brilliant" people
